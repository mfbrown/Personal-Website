#Here We Go

###Web Design Education on the Web

I decided to learn web design a few months back. The story behind this motivation is long, but essentially, I'm on the lookout for new opportunities in the future, I want to aquire some in-demand skills, and I'd like some skills that are useful in many places life might take me.

Since I've already graduated from college and also hold down a full time job, I've decided to use some of the many online tools available to learn the languages and concepts necessary for this business. I highly recommend both [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) and [Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com). Currently I am working my way through an extensive CSS course on Treehouse.

###Where I Am

So, here's where I am so far. I've created the [website](www.mfbrowndesigns.com) that brought you here. I've completed the HTML, CSS, and most of the Javascript courses on Codecademy and am working through the "Become A Web Designer" learning adventure on Treehouse. I'm hosting this blog on Tumblr, for the moment. I'm working on getting a [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) blog up and running, but it's requiring some technical skills I haven't quite mastered yet. Finally, I'm learning Markdown, which this post was written in.

###Where I'm Going

I'm starting a list of goals to reach in the near future. Dates TBD.

- Set up Ghost Blog and/or create custom Tumblr theme for this blog.
- Finish Media Queries to complete responsive design of my website.
- Complete a few CSS Transition and animation excercies and publish them on Codepen.
- Finish my current Treehouse Learning Adventure.
- Start my first client work.

It's a long list and it will take some time, but I'm excited about everything I have to learn.
